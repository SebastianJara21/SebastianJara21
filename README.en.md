## ðŸš€ Featured Projects (Summary)

- **Entrepreneurship System based on Complexity Science**  
  This solution focuses on retroactively defining the growth flow of a system,  
  allowing it to self-regulate, sustain, and evolve efficiently. Developed in Python,  
  it's powered by a Discord bot that manages complex interactions: handling internal economies,  
  contribution regulation, and community self-management â€” all geared toward achieving a  
  common goal of shared benefit. Due to the nature of these projects, I cannot disclose more details.

- **Automation with n8n, low-code platforms & AI**  
  Intelligent workflows leveraging low-code tools and LLMs to deliver real solutions for complex problems.  
  These workflows integrate multiple APIs and webhooks to provide customized services or products tailored to the client's needs.
